# Express.js — Introduction

Welcome to the **Express.js Course**.
This course introduces you to one of the most widely used frameworks in back-end development — **Express.js**.
You’ll learn how Express simplifies working with Node.js and how to build fast, efficient APIs and full-stack applications.

---

## Background

When **Node.js** was released in 2009, it changed the landscape of web development.
For the first time, JavaScript could be used on both the client and server sides, allowing developers to build full-stack applications using a single language.

While Node.js is powerful, building a server from scratch can be verbose and repetitive — especially when managing routing, middleware, and security.

Then, in **2010**, **Express.js** arrived.

## Why Express.js?

Express is a **lightweight yet powerful** framework built on top of Node.js.
It simplifies and streamlines backend development by handling:

- Routing and URL handling
- Middleware integration
- Request and response management
- Server logic and error handling

Express powers countless production applications — from small startups to tech giants — thanks to its simplicity, flexibility, and deep integration with the **NPM ecosystem**.

Need database access, caching, or WebSockets?
There’s a package for that.

## What You’ll Build

This course includes two main projects:

1. **Startup Planet** — A RESTful API that provides data about up-and-coming companies.
2. **Spiral Solutions** — A database-driven eCommerce site that builds on top of what you learned from the first project.

Both projects are built inside **Scrimba’s interactive IDE**, allowing you to code and test full-stack applications directly in the browser.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you’re comfortable with:

- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Common array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Making network requests using `fetch()`
- Using `async` and `await`

No prior knowledge of **Node.js** or **Express.js** is required — we’ll start from the ground up.

If you’re unfamiliar with basic backend concepts like headers, content types, or HTTP status codes, it’s recommended to check out the provided intro scrim before beginning.

## Let’s Get Started

You’ll begin by building your first Express API.
From there, you’ll explore routes, middleware, databases, and real-world application structures.

Let’s dive in and start learning Express.js — fast, simple, and powerful.
